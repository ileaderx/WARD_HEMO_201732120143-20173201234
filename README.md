this readme is to explain the project of Object-Oriented Programming Course in this project we made an oaps open access page service
wgich made by our seniors and we had been asked to develop it, and through the proccess of developing we had faced many problems in reading the code
and even in changig things inside the code and the more i try to fix the more i face problems i have been facing problems for so long time
and i couldn't really finish it all so i just kept my work on this level.
